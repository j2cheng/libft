# libft

This is the first project in the 42 Core program. It is about coding a C library. 

**Task:** Rrecreate a lot of general purpose functions your program and future projects will rely on. 

Functions recreated are all as listed in both, mandatory and bonus part as per [PDF document](https://github.com/j2cheng/libft/blob/master/Libft.pdf). 
Thorough definition of each function can be found in the manual.

While attempts have been made to independently write `main()`, third party testers have also been used to ensure functions are robust.
